document service as a blueprint of Poirot capstone project. It provides a solution for collecting person's information based on open source resources. Scope of the project A project exposes REST APIs for getting input from the researcher, exposes REST API to get collected data, performs person of interest searches on LinkedIn and Facebook social networks without requiring to be logged in or having application tokens. Searches done anonymously. Intended audience Any researcher who fights with misinformation and the spreading of fake news. Project Overview and Goals A projects helps to the researches to gather information about person of interest. It helps to fight with spread of fake news or disinformation. A project uses: Java 17, gradle as a build tool, dockerd, Spring Boot framework, MongoDB as document database. Project length is about two month. Milestones Week 1 - Definition of problem Week 2 - requirement gathering Week 3 - requirement and resource analysis Week 4 - Software Design Document Week 5 - Implementation Week 6 - Testing, Final Polishing, finalization of documentation System Functionality Rest Controller - exposes REST APIs GET /linkedin/persons POST /linkedin/persons POST /facebook/persons GET /facebook/persons Services LinkedIn service - provides functionality for making LinkedIn searches and gathering relevant information. Facebook service - provide functionality for making Facebook searches and gathering relevant information. Repositories LinkedIn repository services as an interface for making common operations related to mongoDB Facebook repository services as an interface for making common operations related to mongoDB MongoDB - persists collected data, runs as a microservice, docker container. Facebook-Scrapper-Page - performs facebook scrapping pages. Runs as a docker container. Architectural Design provides a blueprint of the system\u2019s structure. Communication types: Client (a browser) communicates with a Service (Poirot) via HTTP synchronous protocol. A client sends request to the server and waits for the response. We may to use asynchronous protocol, for example AMQP however it is a more complicated and due to the time constraints we are not going to use it. Our application separated on two different microservices: a main one - Poirot and second one - mongo db server. Microservices helps to divide monolith application into separated and manageable services. As benefits, it gives us: scalability, maintainability and flexibility. Each service becomes more small and easier to deploy, independently. For example, if we fixed a bug in Poirot, we do not need to redeploy mongo server. It also reduces deployment time, make fault recovery more robust. Another benefit is a testing. Becasue to the nature of microservices the can in less effort test more efficiently. However, it is also adds overhead representing kind of disadvantages. For developer, it represents a difficulty to debug system. In case of many microservices it is challenging to get and synchronise logs from them. Data also can be out of consistency, management and integrity. To test single microservice is easy, however to test end two end becomes a challenge. Detailed Design Rest controllers PersonalInformationFetcher - exposes REST API to get input from the user.

Communication types: Client (a browser) communicates with a Service (Poirot) via HTTP synchronous protocol. A client sends request to the server and waits for the response. We may to use asynchronous protocol, for example AMQP however it is a more complicated and due to the time constraints we are not going to use it. Our application separated on two different microservices: a main one - Poirot and second one - mongo db server. Microservices helps to divide monolith application into separated and manageable services. As benefits, it gives us: scalability, maintainability and flexibility. Each service becomes more small and easier to deploy, independently. For example, if we fixed a bug in Poirot, we do not need to redeploy mongo server. It also reduces deployment time, make fault recovery more robust. Another benefit is a testing. Becasue to the nature of microservices the can in less effort test more efficiently. However, it is also adds overhead representing kind of disadvantages. For developer, it represents a difficulty to debug system. In case of many microservices it is challenging to get and synchronise logs from them. Data also can be out of consistency, management and integrity. To test single microservice is easy, however to test end two end becomes a challenge.","title":"Architectural Design"},{"location":"SDD/#detailed-design","text":"Rest controllers PersonalInformationFetcher - exposes REST API to get input from the user.

It is quite important to hide searcher's information. VPN helps to give a solution for this requirement. Gewirtz (2024) explains: \"The purpose of a VPN is to provide you with security and privacy as you communicate over the internet. Most of the internet's core protocols (communication methods) were designed to route around failure, rather than secure data. While some standards have developed, not all internet apps are secure. Many still send their information without any security or privacy protection whatsoever. This leaves any internet user vulnerable to criminals who might steal your banking or credit card information, governments who might want to eavesdrop on their citizens, and other internet users who might want to spy on you for a whole range of nefarious reasons.\" If a researcher logged in into LI account and looks for user's profile, LI notifies a person what a \"searcher\" was looking his profile. Using VPN we will hide part of such information. In addition, using Google Dorks we gather information without showing up our identity to the person of interest. Software requirements Use cases: As a user I would like to be able to gather person's information on LinkedIn As a user I would like to be able to gather person's information on Facebook As a user I would like to persist gathered information into database As a user I would like to use CRUD repository As a user I would like to get REST API for CRUD operations Introduction As part of fight with misinformation, disinformation and fake news detection is one of the required steps are to get knowledge about person of interest. Existing OSINT tools can bring problems related to security or lack of maintenance. The purpose of this project to create a suitable solution. Product scope is having MVC layer, Business layer & Persistence layer. However, it will not have a data analytics and data visualization layers. Functional Requirements External Interface Requirements User Interface is a Swagger pages which make call to the backend functionality. Non-functional Requirements Security Capacity - ideally storage should be dynamically allocated, aws s3 is a good candidate. For the capstone purposes it is enough to have 250Gb. Compatibility - minimum requirements for hardware are: RAM 8GB, CPU Apple M1, 8 Cores. Reliability and availability - response for each request should be persisted. DB should have a backup last 24 hours. Each microservice should implement its healthcheck, for cluster management. Scalability - the minimum number of pods is one, maximum is 3. k8s configured for scale up or scale down. Maintainability - CI/CD triggered on each commit. In addition, on master merge triggers a redeploy logic. In addition, part of CI process added logic of checking dependencies updates and security code scanning. Usability - a service exposes Swagger, accepts curl commands as well. Project Resources Resources Identified A computer a main source of machinery. Text editor or IDE to write code, edit documentation. Browser - a firefox or chrome. To surf internet. Internet connection - to do a research VPN - for secure connection outside the world. Any VPN is suitable, in my case i use Surfshark. A person with required skill set (me) Time - entire project takes 6 weeks, each week is intended to Specific Sprint. A lenght of each Spring is exactly one week long. Challenges gathering facebook information Facebook requires to be registered in order to get user's information. Registration allow to sources to know who is gathering information. Our goal to expose as little as possible information for anybody. So, first we do a google dorks as site:facebook.com \"John Doe\" . It brings us a search page which we have to scrap. One of the scapping results is user's profile URL which contains information related to username. Username can be as same as a user's first and last names or different. In addition, we can also find userID info, which can be useful. Next challenge is to parse search results and get valuable information. Fortunately, there are a lot of available libraries which helps us to do it. During the number of ddg request I got: \"Please complete the following challenge to confirm this search was made by a human\" Basically it means I cannot automate web scrapping using current approach. Management of Resources Time The longevity of the project is about 6 weeks. Each week 15 hours of work. Raw materials /software to be used IDE - Intellij, java 17, python 3, docker, macOS, firefox as a browser, VPN - surfshark Docker, MongoDB, Spring Boot framework, gradle, docker-compose Java is good language, I am familiar with it, 17 version is a minimum version that requires Spring Boot. Docker is a technology which makes possible to run application as a service. Using k8s makes to manage our cluster of microservices if we need to scale. In general using docker images gives us ability in matter of seconds to redeploy our application for more newest version. Gradle is a build tool. To build a project we have two options: maven or gradle. Gradle is more modern building tool. MongoDB is chosen because it is document database, allows us to save data simply as json file. To use relational database is not suitable for this kind of project due to the data model. In addition to scale not relational database is much easier that relational. Human resources Me and Professor as mentor and adviser. I am going to implement this project. Machinery and equipment MacBook AIR it is what I have. Financial Resources A cost of the project is the much as 300 usd. Infomration and data Using duckduck search engine, Google Scholar and google dorks. Using google requires to be loged in, which not serves well for our porposes, duckduck is allows to make search queries anonymously. Also any information used or looked at mentioned in References. Gathered information saved in MongoDB. Software Requirements and Specification Software Requirements Should expose REST API in order to get input from the user like first name, last name, email, location Optional: email, location Should save gathered information about a person of interest.
